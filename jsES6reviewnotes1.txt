//getting back into the swing of things, doing a review over
//past exercises.

//One thing I want to make a point of remembering is that
//the let keyword creates distinct different variables
//within the loops you create them in. example:

let printNumTwo;
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    if (i === 2) {
        printNumTwo = function() {
            return i;
        };
    }
}

//Four distinct i variables are created [0,1,2,3,4]
//and interact with the code seperately within this scope
//per the let keyword
